# Module 1: Exercise 2

Write a program that asks for two number from the user and prints out the sum of the two numbers.

Hints:
* define a function called `add(num1, num2)` that returns the sum of num1 and num2
* use `input()` twice to get the two numbers from the user. Remember that `input()` returns a string so you will have to convert these strings to integers to add them
* call `add(num1, num2)` to perform the addition
