## Recommended Use

Use the material in these modules as a guide for what to teach. If teaching on Zoom, open a blank file in an IDE and write the code out line by line, explaining to the student what is going on. Have them follow along on their IDE while you do this. Then, for the exercises, switch to the student sharing screen so you can observe how they think.

I recommend setting your students up with PyCharm as their first IDE, as it is super easy to use!

## Dependencies

Python 3.8 (or higher)
PyQt
