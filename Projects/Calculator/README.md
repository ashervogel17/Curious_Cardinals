# Basic Calculator Program
### Written by Asher Vogel

## To practice

Open [student_calculator_functions.py](Exercise/student_calculator_functions.py) in the [Exercise](Exercise) directory, and fill in the body of the function `evaluate_expression`.
The function takes in three parameters:
1. the first number in the calculation (float)
2. the operation, either +, -, *, or / (string)
3. the second number in the calculation (float)

and returns the result of the calculation. Return None if there is an issue.

To use your new program, run [the driver](Exercise/driver.py) in the [Exercise](Exercise) directory.

To test your new program, run [the test file](Exercise/test.py) in the [Exercise](Exercise) directory.

## Solution

Run [the driver](Solution/driver.py) in the [Solution](Solution) directory. The correct code for the exercise can be found in [calculator_functions.py](Solution/calculator_functions.py).
