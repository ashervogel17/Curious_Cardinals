# Tip Calculator

Write a program that:

1. asks the user to enter the cost of their meal
2. tells them what to tip

Hints:

* use the `input()` function to find out how much the user's meal cost
* use `float()` to convert the cost to a float
* use `str()` to convert the cost to a string

Bonus: use string concatenation to print the recommended tip in a sentence
